"""Campus AI OS 5.2.11 (from 5.3.0 item 5) - kernel cargo from the 2026-09-21 hand runs.

(a) QUICKSTART.md was headed "Campus AI OS v4.1" in the public 5.2.9 release: root
    docs carry no version literal in their title (the manifest and workspace.json
    own the version). (b) README.md / QUICKSTART.md said "education business"
    whatever the pack: the business noun now comes from the active pack.
(c) /campus-first-win offered a fixed three; it now also offers the active pack's
    own domain skills, and the education default is unchanged.
Kernel-only; runs everywhere.
