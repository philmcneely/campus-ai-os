# Changelog

All notable changes to the Campus AI OS kernel. Format follows Keep a Changelog; versions follow Semantic Versioning (security fixes are patch releases). Released entries are never rewritten; corrections go in a later entry. The packaged artifact hash for every release is in the sibling `campus-ai-os-v{version}.PACKAGE.json`, never retyped here.

## [Unreleased]

## [5.2.18] - 2026-10-22

Repairs the four findings of the Codex audit of the public 5.2.17 repository and release (`outputs/2026-10/reports/2026-10-22-campus-ai-os-github-audit.md`, WO-2026-10-22-04; WO-2026-10-20-06).

### Security
- **Runtime writers stay inside the campus (audit F1, P1).** The run-ID minter, the registration-spec writer and the Campus Map followed a planted link out of the campus: `outputs` linked elsewhere put a run (and every draft written into it) outside; a dangling link at the spec created the outside target; a linked `campus-map/` overwrote an outside file. Now:
  - the minter creates the run directory one folder at a time, refuses any link on the way down (the standalone path too), and checks that the result resolves inside the campus; its `results.json` is still opened exclusively;
  - the spec writer (and `--capture-notes`) refuses a link anywhere from the campus root to the file, and writes a fresh temp file renamed into place, which also replaces a read-only copy without the old chmod;
  - the Campus Map refuses a link on the way down to its output folder under the campus, and writes a fresh temp file renamed into place, so a link at the file itself is replaced, never written through (custom output folders get the second guard).

### Fixed
- **Developer install route (audit F2, P1).** The README's `/plugin marketplace add trainingsites/campus-ai-os` (Claude Code) and Codex "Add marketplace" pointed at a repo with no marketplace catalog. The kernel tree now carries `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` and `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`, both named `campus-ai-os` with the root plugin as source; Codex CLI 0.163 registers the repo as a marketplace. The buyer's `.plugin`/`.zip` leaves both catalogs out.
- **An edit under an intact stamp is no longer called current (audit F3, P2).** The spec stamp now records the body's sha256; `--check` reports a body that changed after generation as hand-edited, a refresh refuses until the edits are captured as overrides, and the replaced copy is kept as `registration-block-spec.md.bak-{UTC}`. Older stamps without a body hash are compared against a fresh render from the same inputs, or backed up when that cannot be rebuilt.
- **The Cowork kit rule matches the checker (audit F4, P2).** Canon §0 required every manifest file, but founding copies the core tier only, so a healthy new campus failed the written rule. Now: every core file required, on-demand files optional unless the tool about to run is one of them, any present file must match, any unlisted entry fails, the same as `kernel_kit.py check`.

### Added
- `tests/test_containment_5218.py` (14): links at `outputs`, deeper in the run path and at `teams-shared` refused with nothing written outside; a dangling spec link and a linked `.campus-os` refused; stamped edits seen, refresh refused, then captured and backed up; an old stamp still checked; Campus Map folder and file links; the cloud rule and the checker agree on core-only, full and changed kits; both catalogs valid and absent from the buyer file. Mutation-checked: each fix removed makes its fixtures fail.

## [5.2.17] - 2026-10-22

Carries all of 5.2.16 (kernel kit, the Codex F1 repair, the campus finder) plus one fix found while the 5.2.16 audit was under way (WO-2026-10-20-06).

### Security
- **Quarantine never follows a link out of the campus.** The F1 repair added a quarantine for unlisted kit files under `.campus-os/kernel-quarantine/`. If `kernel-quarantine` was a planted link, `install --repair` followed it and moved the unlisted files outside the campus, into a folder and under file names the planter chose. A file of their choosing could land anywhere the owner can write. Now the quarantine refuses a link at `.campus-os` or `kernel-quarantine` and moves nothing; each run creates a fresh folder `{UTC stamp}-{12 hex}` that must not already exist; it only moves into folders it just created; it never replaces an existing entry.

### Added
- Fixtures: a planted quarantine link is refused with nothing moved outside and the file left for the owner (the check still flags it); every quarantine gets a fresh, unguessable folder. Mutation-checked: without the link checks, the first fixture fails.

## [5.2.16] - 2026-10-22 (never published: superseded by 5.2.17 during its audit)

Carries all of 5.2.15 (the Codex audit F1 repair) plus one campus-finder fix, folded in before 5.2.15 was audited, on the owner's call (WO-2026-10-20-06).

### Fixed
- **The campus is found when the host opens the folder above it.** The campus rule only walked up from the working folder. The owner's Cowork mounts `TrainingSites/` while the campus is the child `TrainingSites/Claude-Cowork/`, so `resolve_context.py --find-campus` found nothing from the mount (exit 3), and every team that followed the rule said "install Campus OS first" (reported by the Email Desk session, 2026-10-22). Now, when nothing above is a campus, the finder accepts exactly one campus among the start folder's children: real folders only, hidden folders and links skipped, one level down. Two or more child campuses are never guessed between: `--find-campus` exits 3 and lists them (`several_campuses`), and a concept lookup refuses until the owner picks. A campus above still wins. `--json` now says how it was found (`here`, `above`, `child`). The one owner of the rule, `templates/context-files.md` ("Campus rule"), says the same.

### Added
- `tests/test_campus_finder_5216.py`: the mount-above layout, two children refused, a campus above wins, hidden and linked children ignored, only one level down.

### Known gaps
- `context-weight.mjs` and `/campus-map` keep their own walk-up (the doctor passes `--root`); teams that run with `--campus-root .` from the mount folder should `cd` into the campus first (Email Desk 1.0.2 does).

## [5.2.15] - 2026-10-22 (never published: superseded by 5.2.16 before its audit)

Repairs the one release blocker from the Codex audit of the packaged 5.2.14 artifact (`outputs/2026-10/reports/2026-10-22-campus-ai-os-v5.2.14-codex-audit.md`). 5.2.14 was never published; this release carries all of its kernel-kit work (see the [5.2.14] entry) plus the fix below (WO-2026-10-20-06).

### Security
- **The kit runs only the bytes it checked (audit F1).** The 5.2.14 check compared the files the plugin lists but accepted anything else in the kit, and kit tools import from their own folder. A campus writer could add a stdlib-named module (`tools/secrets.py`) or a bytecode cache stamped to match a real source (`tools/__pycache__/contract.*.pyc`); the plugin-anchored check still said OK, and the minter or the doctor then ran the planted code. Now:
  - `kernel_kit.py check` fails on any file, cache folder or link in the kit that the manifest does not list (`unexpected`), and checks every on-demand file that is present, not only the core tier.
  - Kit tools run as `python3 -I -B` (canon §0, preamble §5, every documented command): the kit folder is never searched before the standard library, and no bytecode is written into the kit.
  - The two tools that import their siblings (`doctor_evidence.py`, `resolve_context.py`) put the kit folder at the end of the import path and, when run as tools, point Python's bytecode cache at an unguessable path that does not exist, so a planted `__pycache__` is never read. The doctor runs its sub-tools the same way (`-I -B -X pycache_prefix=…`).
  - `install` (and `--repair`) moves unlisted files and caches to `.campus-os/kernel-quarantine/{UTC stamp}/` before copying (moved, never deleted) and reports them; a link inside the kit is refused for the owner to remove.
  - The Cowork inline check in canon §0 lists every file and link in the kit (links as `LINK`), so an extra file or a cache fails it there too.
- The doctor's `kernel_kit` line fails on unlisted files and on an unreadable stamp, and its OK wording now says what was checked: "every file present matches the plugin and nothing else is in it" (audit observation 1).
- A malformed `KIT.json` (non-string paths, wrong types) is reported as `stamp_invalid` instead of raising; duplicate paths are checked once; a path outside the kit is reported as changed, never read.

### Added
- Fixtures for both audit probes and for repair: an unlisted module fails the anchored check and does not run under the documented command; a planted cache fails the check and is not loaded by the doctor or the campus finder even if the check is skipped; repair quarantines both and the kit checks clean again; a changed on-demand file fails a core check; a malformed stamp is reported. Mutation-checked: without the cache redirect the doctor runs the planted cache; without the unexpected-file rule both probes pass the check; without quarantine repair leaves the payload.

### Corrections to the [5.2.14] entry
- Its "Known gaps" line "Not yet proven in a live Cowork session" is out of date: the live Cowork gate passed on 2026-10-22 (fresh campus founded with the kit, byte-identical to the manifest; the owner's campus upgraded 5.2.13 -> 5.2.14). 5.2.14 was never published.

## [5.2.14] - 2026-10-21 (never published: failed the Codex artifact audit, F1; superseded by 5.2.15)

The kernel kit: kernel tools now run from a copy inside the campus, so they work in cloud Cowork (WO-2026-10-20-06; James chose option A, 2026-10-21). Test build on the branch; publish only after the Cowork release gate.

### Fixed
- **Kernel tools could not reach the campus in cloud Cowork.** Cowork runs the installed plugin in a cloud container that cannot see the campus; the campus is mounted in a separate device shell with Python but no plugin. Sessions typed run_ids by hand with round placeholder times (`…-000000000`) and skipped every validator, and `/campus-doctor` could not run (Email Desk tests, 2026-10-20 and 2026-10-21). The kernel now keeps a **kernel kit** in the campus, `.campus-os/kernel/`: a mirror of the tools a campus needs in the plugin's own folder layout, stamped with `KIT.json` (kit version + sha256 per file). The tools find their files relative to themselves, so they need no changes. Same pattern as the campus copy of `resolve-seat.py`.
- `tools/doctor_evidence.py` imports its sibling tools under `python3 -I` (isolated mode left the script folder off `sys.path`).
- `/campus-doctor` never edits a team's `results.json`. On the 5.2.14 Cowork test it "fixed" a failing Email Desk file by stamping its own time as `generated_at` and guessing all three completion answers. It now names the file, the missing fields and the owning team, and offers to update or re-run that team.

### Security
- **The kit is checked against the plugin, never against itself** (security review of this branch, 2026-10-21). Anyone who can write the campus (a shared folder, another team, an AI session following injected text) could edit a kit tool and recompute its hash in `KIT.json`; a check that trusts the campus stamp would pass it. `kernel_kit.py check --manifest` takes the expected hashes and version from the installed plugin's `tools/kit-manifest.json`; the doctor anchors on it (this tree's when run from the plugin, `--kit-manifest` when run from the kit) and reports a kit that matched only its own stamp as unchecked, never `ok`. In Cowork the canon has the model hash the kit with its own inline command, not a kit tool, and compare with the manifest it read from the plugin. A changed or `newer` kit is never run; a planted newer stamp no longer blocks repair forever (`install --repair`, on the owner's go).
- **`install` never writes through a symlink.** A planted link at `.campus-os`, the kit folder, a subfolder or a kit file is refused, every write goes to a fresh file renamed into place, and nothing lands outside `.campus-os/kernel/`. `check` counts a kit file that is a symlink as changed.

### Added
- **`tools/kernel_kit.py`** - the one owner of the kit list (`core`, `on_demand`, `plugin_only`, `maintainer_only`); `manifest` (writes/checks `tools/kit-manifest.json`), `check` (file-by-file sha256, and `current` / `stale` / `newer` against the installed plugin), `install` (where one shell sees plugin and campus). Forward-only: a newer kit is never replaced by an older one.
- **Where kernel tools run, defined once:** `templates/run-id-and-interop.md` §0 (the campus copy reaches every installed team, so no team repackages) defines `{kernel}` = `.campus-os/kernel`, the check before first use, and the by-hand fallback (real UTC time, never a placeholder; `run_id_minted_by: "hand"`). Kernel preamble §5 points kernel skills at it.
- `/campus-start` writes the core kit first (file-tool copy where the plugin cannot see the campus); `/update-workspace` item 18 copies or refreshes it on every path, the up-to-date path included; `/campus-doctor` runs from the kit with `--installed-version` and gains a thirteenth section, `kernel_kit`.
- `tools/package.py` refuses to package with a stale `tools/kit-manifest.json`; build gate 8b requires both founding and upgrade to create `.campus-os/kernel/`; `tests/test_kernel_kit.py` runs the kit with the plugin tree deleted and fails when any skill, canon or contract names a `tools/` script that no kit list accounts for.

### Known gaps
- `tools/gen_department_entries.py` (item 12e's org-chart re-derive) reads the whole niche pack and stays plugin-only; where no shell sees the plugin, the re-derive is skipped and said.
- `/campus-map` still runs `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/campus-map/generate.mjs`.
- Not yet proven in a live Cowork session: the file-tool copy, the device shell's Python version, and `node` there (the release gate).

## [5.2.13] - 2026-10-18

Repairs the one release blocker from the Codex audit of the packaged 5.2.12 artifact (`outputs/2026-10/reports/2026-10-17-campus-ai-os-v5.2.12-codex-audit.md`). 5.2.12 was never published; this release carries everything in its entry below. Patch: no new keys.

### Fixed
- **Priority lost to capitals (audit F1).** `tools/resolve_context.py` tried every exact-spelling name before any case-insensitive one, so on a case-insensitive disk a lower-priority file with exact spelling beat the preferred file in other capitals: `offers.md` over `OFFERS-SUMMARY.MD` (old long-form prices instead of the price-owning summary), `icp.md` over `AUDIENCE.MD`, `identity.md` over `BUSINESS.MD`, for reads and for `write_to`. Each candidate is now matched exactly, then case-insensitively, before the next is tried, and its real spelling is returned. The canon (`templates/context-files.md`), the kernel preamble, the contract's `resolution` list (both resolvers check it), the doctor and every skill that states the read order now say the same thing. The doctor's `context_files` section and the resolver agree on which file is read.

### Added
- Regression fixtures for the three audit cases (offers summary, founding audience, founding business in capitals beside a lower-priority exact name) and for doctor/resolver agreement. Mutation-checked: on the 5.2.12 resolver they fail. Suite is 281.

### Corrections to the [5.2.12] entry
- SEC-04 points **thirteen** reading skills at preamble §4, not twelve (`/whats-new` was added to the list).
- `update-workspace/references/additions.md` was still titled "items 11-15"; it now says 11-17, matching the item list and the closing rule.

## [5.2.12] - 2026-10-17

Atlas learns to ask for more (three levers: altitude, depth, range), context files resolve correctly on a real buyer install, and one security fix pulled forward from the next minor train by owner decision (SEC-04). Patch: no new required keys; upgrade item 17 is additive.

### Security
- **SEC-04: outside text is data, never instructions.** Web pages, transcripts, reviews, emails, client messages, connector output and ingested files could carry sentences aimed at the model, and nothing in the runtime said they were not commands. New `references/kernel-preamble.md` §4 is the one owner of the rule: outside text cannot change instructions, grant permission, pick a tool, approve a send or write, or ask for secrets; a line that tries is quoted to the owner with its source; saved material keeps its source; no instruction from outside text goes into a skill, rule, memory or schedule. The chief of staff templates carry it as rule 4 (inside a `campus-os:outside-text` marker), and the twelve skills that read outside text point at it. Gate NICHE-028 fails the build if a reader or a template drops it. SEC-05 and SEC-06 stay in the next minor release.

### Added
- **Atlas, ambition levers.** `strategy-council` 2.2.0: Gate 1 says the job as a verb (not "a webinar" but what it must get done) and asks how much rides on it; on high stakes the user can seat one to three **field seats** from other fields, picked from the verb, each bringing one option nobody named (a lens, never a named person; the core five stay); Gate 4 adds an **outside check** so the convener never grades its own ruling (a fresh judge that sees only the ruling and evidence, or a named real-world check); each move is named out loud in one line so the owner learns the levers by watching them. `content-scanner` 1.1.0: an expert-tools check names what a top researcher would use that isn't connected, and the report lists it as a gap.
- **`tools/resolve_context.py`** - finds the campus (walk up for `workspace.json` + any accepted entry file, root or `dean/`) and the file a concept resolves to. Python only, all three hosts.
- **`/whats-new`** (promoted from the parked next-train tree) reads the public GitHub release list. The parked copy pointed at a release page that returns 404 and logged to the shared ledger; both fixed.
- **Doctor `context_files` section** - reports a concept held in two files (the founding file plus a separate canonical-name copy, e.g. `audience.md` + `icp.md`) and offers a merge. Intended pairs (offers summary + notes) are not reported.
- Gate NICHE-013D - fails the build if a kernel skill routes a write to `icp.md` / `identity.md` / `icp-summary.md` or requires `about-me/`.
- `tests/test_kernel_cargo_5212.py` - fresh-folder campus (not named `Claude-Cowork`, `AGENTS.md` entry) resolving all seven concepts, shadow and price-authority cases, both gates, the Atlas levers and SEC-04. Suite is 279.

### Fixed
- **Context files on a real install.** The canon tried the canonical name first, so a thin `icp.md` / `identity.md` written later hid the full `audience.md` / `business.md` from founding. Read order is now founding name first (offers keeps `offers-summary.md` first: it owns every price); `contracts/campus.json` carries `read_order` per concept and both resolvers return it. The contract no longer claims founding writes `brand.md` (nothing does). `grill-me` and `session-capture` route facts to the resolved file, never a new `icp.md`. `first-week` stopped requiring `about-me/about-me.md`, which nothing writes, so it no longer sends every founded owner back to `/campus-start`; `wiki-query` and the map read `workspace.json` `assistant_name` instead of `about-me/`. The campus copy of the canon is refreshed on upgrade (12e), so installed teams pick up the new order without repackaging.
- **Upgrade steps that never ran.** The v5.2.4 seat-resolver refresh had no numbered item in `/update-workspace`, so the closing rule never named it. Item 17 runs it and the 5.2.12 additions on every path.
- **Founding matched only part of the org chart** (found on the 5.2.12 cold test). Founding made one folder per entry in the pack's `departments[]`, which lists only the departments the pack staffs, so Operations, Finance and People sat on the org chart with no folder; the close said "five of the eight" and the doctor flagged the folders. Founding now makes one folder per department on the org chart (every `type: department` entry except Dean's office), and gate NICHE-022 fails the build if a pack department has no org-chart entry. The close also bundled the department-rename question with the next-step offer; the rename is now its own turn and the close asks one question. Owner-facing text names a department only by its registry label (the close had said "Education" for the department labelled Teaching), and `/full-onboarding` no longer carries a typed five-department list.
- **Skills still spoke the v3 org.** Eight kernel files named a "Content Department" and a "Customer Department" (Clients / Coaching / Students) that no campus has had since the staff departments arrived; `morning-brief`, `weekly-review`, `launch-planner`, `course-builder`, `lesson-planner` and `social-planner` read `content/memory.md`, `marketing/memory.md` or `sales/memory.md`, paths no founded campus has, so the morning brief could never see department work; `first-week` Day 4 read a `library/skill-to-department-map.json` that does not exist. Kernel preamble §2 now defines departments once (the org chart, by label, folder per `dept_dir` or `departments/{id}/`), every one of those skills reads through it, and gate NICHE-029 fails the build on a typed department name or a v3 department path.
- **No staging archives in the campus.** The cold install left a `campus.tgz` the model had used to stage the scaffold; on a host where campus files can be created but not deleted, it could not be removed. Kernel preamble §2: write each file at its final path, never through an archive or temp copy.
- The council's Gate 1 asked the sharpening and stakes questions in one message; the stakes question is now its own turn.
- `/campus-doctor` reports every evidence section. It was told to explain "eleven" sections and had no rule for the new `context_files` one, so the line was dropped; a fixture now ties the count and the per-section rules to the tool's section list.
- `tools/mint_run_id.py` filed a run under the wall-clock month instead of the month of the `now` it was given; a fixture pinned to September began failing on 1 October.

### Changed
- Dean templates (`templates/dean-CLAUDE.md`, `templates/dean-CODEX.md`): End of Session now opens with a save-as-you-go rule. Decisions, open items and things worth keeping go to `daily/{today}.md` (and `wiki/` when they compound) the moment they happen, not only at wrap-up, because most sessions end without one. Found on the owner's own campus 2026-10-13 (WO-2026-10-13-01). Needs the Cowork release gate before it ships.

## [5.2.11] - 2026-09-23

Repairs the one release blocker from the Codex re-audit of the packaged 5.2.10 artifact, and carries the pack-neutral wording the first niche builds need. Patch: no new keys, no migration beyond the version marker.

### Fixed
- **Write instructions still sent a co-primary to the shared ledger.** An assigned Claude Code or Codex client resolves `role: primary` with `owns_clock: false`, but the sanctioned team-plugin wording in `templates/ledger-paths.md`, `/campus-first-win` and `/full-onboarding` told it to append to `dean/.activity.jsonl`. They, and the same wording in `hr-recruit`, `promote-skills`, `templates/model-routing.md`, `playbooks/README.md` and the one-recording playbook, now name the ledger the seat resolves to; only the clock owner writes the shared file. Team plugins cut earlier keep the old phrase until their next release; `ledger-paths.md` says how to read it.
- `QUICKSTART.md` was headed "Campus AI OS v4.1", also in the public 5.2.9 release. Root doc titles no longer carry a version.
- `README.md` and `QUICKSTART.md` said "education business" whatever the pack; the business noun now comes from the active pack.

### Changed
- `/campus-first-win` also offers the active pack's own domain skills when the pack declares any beyond the three defaults; the education default is unchanged.

### Added
- `tests/test_ledger_writers_5211.py` - runs the real resolver for a non-clock primary and fails if any shipped instruction writes the shared ledger without the clock-owner qualifier.
- `tests/test_kernel_cargo_5211.py` - doc titles, pack-neutral business noun, first-win pack skills.

## [5.2.10] - 2026-09-20

Co-primary reaches every written contract, and the minimum pack plumbing a second niche pack needs. Additive: every new `pack.json` key is optional, a campus founded on 5.2.9 needs no migration beyond the version marker, and the education build assembles file-identical to the source tree.

### Fixed
- **Co-primary had not reached every contract.** The resolver sends a primary client that is not the clock owner to its own ledger shard, but `templates/ledger-paths.md` still said "Primary: `dean/.activity.jsonl`", the generated contract listed `claude-code` and `codex` as satellite by default, and the brain templates and the Codex adapter told every client to append to the shared ledger. All now say one thing: append only to the ledger `resolve-seat.py` returns; only the `clock_owner` client writes the shared ledger. `contracts/campus.json` gains `seat.ledger.clock_owner`, `co_primary` and `write_rule`; `seat.ledger.primary` keeps its value because readers resolve the shared ledger by that key. The remaining Codex lane rules stay with SEC-05.
- **A second in-tree pack failed NICHE-024 by design.** `templates/registry.json` is one derived file; the label-parity check compared it against whichever pack was being checked. It now belongs to the active pack. A non-active pack's registry template is derived when that pack is assembled, by the same generator, so no second copy is stored.
- `tools/build_niche.py --check` and `tools/gen_department_entries.py` defaulted to the literal `education`. Both now default to the active pack.

### Added
- **`packs/active.json`** - one pointer, `{"active_pack": "..."}`, naming the pack this tree is built for. `campus-start`, its interview reference, `wiki-ingest` and `wiki-query` resolve the pack through it; `--assemble` rewrites it for the pack being built.
- **`shared_skills[]`** (optional, `pack.json`) - a pack borrows another pack's domain skills. `--assemble` keeps them; ownership is read from the skill's own `pack:` tag, so it still resolves after the owning pack's folder is removed.
- **`hires[]`** (optional, `pack.json`) - a pack may carry pre-vetted hire manifests in the `.campus-os/hires/*.json` shape. Key and gate only; routing to a hire is not part of this release.
- Gate checks **NICHE-025** (active pack pointer; no skill spells a pack folder), **NICHE-026** (shared skills) and **NICHE-027** (pack hires: full 40-character pin, https repo, license, never above `draft-only`).
- `tests/test_phase7_pack_plumbing.py` - 17 fixtures: contract and template parity with the resolver, the pointer, a second in-tree pack, per-pack registry derivation, the file-identical round trip for the active pack, borrowed-skill survival, and hire-manifest rejection cases.
- `packs/professor/pack.json` declares `shared_skills` and an empty `hires`.
- `README.md` links to the public repository.

## [5.2.9] - 2026-09-14

First release prepared for public GitHub distribution (`trainingsites/campus-ai-os`). Scope is the co-primary seat model only; SEC-04/05/06 ride a dedicated security train at 5.3.0 or later by owner decision (2026-09-13).

### Fixed
- `tests/test_phase0_coprimary.py` doctor fixtures issued their host binding against the frozen fixture clock while the doctor reads wall-clock time, so the suite began failing on its own three days after 5.2.8. The two doctor fixtures now issue the binding relative to real time; resolver fixtures keep the frozen clock.

### Changed
- **Co-primary seats.** A campus may now designate more than one client `primary` in `seat.json`, so an owner can work from any installed client and finish the job there — closing tasks, writing memory and wiki — instead of filing a proposal for another seat to merge. Single-primary campuses are unaffected: a `seat.json` with one primary and no `clock_owner` resolves exactly as before.
- **`clock_owner` names the single scheduling seat.** One campus, one clock is preserved by configuration rather than by role: `clock_owner` is the one client that runs recurring jobs, holds the host binding, and writes the shared ledger `dean/.activity.jsonl`. Every other primary appends to its own shard. The resolver returns `owns_clock` so a client can tell the difference. A co-primary `seat.json` without a valid `clock_owner` is refused and the caller stays satellite.
- **Doctor is co-primary aware.** Check 11a treats a stamp from any configured primary seat as expected instead of unresolved attribution, while an unrecognised seat is still reported. Check 11d validates the host binding against the clock owner; previously a co-primary config made it advise deleting a valid binding.

### Security
- Unchanged boundary, re-proven by fixture: an unknown machine fingerprint, an unassigned client, a sandbox with no binding, an expired binding, and a binding issued for a client that is not the clock owner all still resolve satellite. Co-primary widens who may write on one recognised installation; it does not widen what counts as recognised.

### Added
- `tests/test_phase0_coprimary.py` — 17 fixtures covering co-primary resolution, clock ownership, ledger routing, the unchanged satellite boundary, config integrity, legacy single-primary behaviour, and the two doctor checks. Suite is 226 tests.

## [5.2.8] - 2026-09-11

### Removed
- **Campus Map public/sales-demo build.** By owner decision after the 5.2.5 security audit, the map is private-only. `--public` (and `PUBLIC=1`) now exit with code 2 and a message; no `campus-map-public.html` can be produced. The 5.2.7 deny-by-default public schema is retired with it. A private map is never shared, so no "safe for strangers" mode exists to get wrong.

### Changed
- `campus-map` skill and command describe the map as private-only and document `--no-remote-fonts` / `CAMPUS_MAP_OFFLINE=1` for a no-network build. CSP and brand-field validation from 5.2.7 remain on every build.

### Security
- Nothing new. 5.2.6 and 5.2.7 closed every finding in the Campus Map generator; 5.2.8 removes the public output path so the SEC-01 class cannot recur. Still open from the audit, for a later train: SEC-04 (untrusted-content section in the instruction chain), SEC-05 (Codex adapter lane rules), SEC-06 (signed release provenance).

## [5.2.7] - 2026-09-11

### Security
- **Campus Map `--public` build now denies by default (SEC-01).** A public map carried raw ledger text and the full bodies of every linked document, brief and report. It now carries aggregates and kernel labels only: no ledger text, file paths, document bodies, brief or wiki titles, result rows, OKR or focus text, and no documents are read at all in public mode. Affects 5.0.0 through 5.2.6.
- **Brand and orchestrator fields could become markup (SEC-03 remainder).** `brand_name` reached `<title>` unescaped and font fields reached CSS unvalidated. The title is escaped, font names and the font import URL must match a narrow grammar or fall back to defaults, and remaining client-side sinks (staff line, scheduled last-run) are escaped. Affects 5.0.0 through 5.2.6.
- **Content Security Policy on every generated map.** Only the generator's own inline script (by hash) may run; styles inline; no other origins.
- **No network request from public builds (SEC-07).** Public maps and `--no-remote-fonts` (or `CAMPUS_MAP_OFFLINE=1`) builds load no web fonts. Private builds still load Google Fonts by default and say so in `SECURITY.md`.

### Added
- Fixtures: public-build canary across ledger, outputs, briefs, results, wiki, goals, scheduled and brand sources; malicious brand and orchestrator fields; CSP and no-network assertions.

## [5.2.6] - 2026-09-10

### Security
- **Campus Map generator: path traversal and symlink escape out of the campus root.** A ledger `output` path such as `outputs/../../secret.txt` passed the root check and its contents were inlined into the generated map, including `--public` builds. Paths are now rejected on any `..`, empty segment, URL scheme, absolute or drive form, or control character, and every document read is proven by real path to live under the campus root as a regular file. Affects 5.0.0 through 5.2.5. Reported by the Codex security audit of the 5.2.5 archive.
- **Campus Map inline viewer: stored XSS through markdown link targets.** Quote characters were not escaped and link targets were emitted verbatim, so a crafted link in any linked markdown file became a live event handler. Quotes are now escaped and link targets are limited to relative paths and http(s)/mailto. Affects 5.0.0 through 5.2.5. Same report.

### Added
- `CHANGELOG.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `README.md` ship with the kernel.
- Fixtures `test_campus_map_security.py` and `test_security_packaging.py`; the packager refuses to cut without a changelog entry for the version.

## [5.2.5] - 2026-09-09
### Fixed
- Doctor: a missing `seat.json` reports as not-applicable rather than red; exit code 1 whenever any line is red, per the skill contract. Found by the Cowork 5.2.4 cold install. <!-- version-literal-ok -->

## [5.2.4] - 2026-09-09
### Added
- Host binding for seat resolution; offers canon; ledger-paths promotion.

## [5.2.3] - 2026-09-08
### Fixed
- Registration spec is materialized on every upgrade path, not only the baseline path. Owner content in a kernel canon now shows the diff and asks rather than overwriting.

## [5.2.2] - 2026-09-08
### Fixed
- Doctor evidence ledger section skips `#` header comment lines.

## [5.2.1] - 2026-09-08
### Fixed
- Doctor version-lockstep check routes an owed upgrade to `/update-workspace` instead of a bare stamp.

## [5.2.0] - 2026-09-08
### Changed
- Single kernel tree; version lockstep across ten homes enforced by the packager; Codex manifest derived from the Claude manifest; machine-readable contract regenerated at cut.
